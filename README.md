# Sorting Visualizer

### You can see it [here](https://seabool.github.io/sort-visualizer/)!

### Why?
I liked the application that was created by the [Cl√©ment Mihailescu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaO6VoaYJv4kS-TQO_M-N_g), so I decided to create it myself in JavaScript.
### Sorting algorithms already added to the app:
- Bubble sort
- Insertion Sort

### Sorting algorithms I want to add:
- Selection Sort.
- Merge Sort.
- Quick Sort.

### Todos
